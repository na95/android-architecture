# todo-mvp

To learn how to implement mvp and relevant knowledge through the **todo** application's implementation.

The [app's spec](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/wiki/To-do-app-specification) and [implementation](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/todo-mvp) refer to [google's achitecture-samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples).

This work gives me a backbone of how an android application created and how the project organised.

# what I've got through this project
- MVP architecture
- Repository pattern
- Dependency Injection pattern
- Project structure
- Product flavors for multiple versions
- SQLite - both basic implementation & using Room lib

# plan for getting more hands-on experience
- Implement reactive for getting database
- Add user login & implement real remote database
